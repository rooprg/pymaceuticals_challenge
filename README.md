**PYMACEUTICALS CHALLENGE**


**(1) Project Overview and Purpose:**

Using a complete data from the most recent animal study at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a comparison of their novel therapy, Capomulin, is needed against the other treatment regimens. Geneneration of all of the tables and figures (TFLs) needed for the technical report of the clinical study is needed as well as a top-level summary of the study results.


**(2) Dataset Description:**


Two .csv datasets are being used for generating the TFLs and the summary, which are stored in the **data** folder:


(a) Mouse_metadata.csv contains information at the subject (mouse) level and includes Mouse ID; Drug Regimen; Age; and Weight


(b) Study_results.csv contains additional information at the subject(mouse) level and included testing timepoint and tumor information (volume and metastases)


**(3) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**


A determination was made about any duplicate information that might be present in the data. Duplicate data for Mouse g989 was dropped before any analyses began.


**(4) Data Visualization Techniques:**


The following were generated and will be described further below-


(a) Summary statistics

(b) Bar charts

(c) Pie charts

(d) Box and Whisker plots

(e) Line plot

(f) Scatter plots


**(5) Results and Analysis:**


(Present the insights gained from the data visualization. Describe any patterns, trends, or relationships discovered in the data)


**(6) Ethical Considerations:**


(Discuss any ethical considerations taken into account during the project, such as data privacy, bias, or fairness)


**(7) Instructions for Interacting with the Project:**


(Provide clear instructions on how to interact with the visualizations, such as how to run the code or access the visualizations)
